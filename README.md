# silkassignment

Overview
This project is designed to build a scalable data pipeline using Flask and MongoDB to handle, deduplicate, and analyze data from multiple sources. It fetches data from APIs, translates it into a common model, deduplicates hosts, and stores the data in MongoDB. The project also includes visualization capabilities to generate insights from the data.
